The files in this dir represent tests of the WCCF Update facility.

Important Pieces

Pieces of the Update Facility include:

(1) the crontab entry that triggers the update script, 
(2) the update script itself that's triggered by the crontab,
(3) the worker script invoked by the update script (#2), and
(4) any related files referenced by the worker script.

Details

(1) The crontab entry (times may differ):

4,19,34,49 * * * * /usr/sbin/wccf_util_update.sh wccf_util_update_worker.sh

Note, the worker script must be in directory /etc/config.

(2) The update script:

/usr/sbin/wccf_util_update.sh

This script looks for the provided file only in /etc/config.  It silently
fails if the file is absent.

(3) The worker script:

wccf_util_update_worker.sh (must reside in /etc/config)

This file has a function that will redefine its behavior to be a NO-OP
if invoked.  All changes to this file (to cause updating) should be
added after the line 36 shown internally (see comments there) and ALSO
must end with a call to the function return_to_null_behavior in order
to restore NO-OP.

(4) The related files:

cron_timeshift.sh
wccf_sensors.cron.TIMESHIFT
wccf_util_update_worker.sh.TIMESHIFT
delayed_reboot.sh
reflash_ap.sh
wccf_util_update_worker.sh.REFLASH


Process Overview

The crontab entry is included by the default crontab file of WCCF.  The
update script is installed in /usr/sbin by WCCF.  The default worker
script is a NO-OP, but contains important content.  Specifically, the
worker script contains a function that is always available to restore
its behavior to NO-OP.  ANY NEW BEHAVIOR INTRODUCED INTO THE WORKER
MUST ALWAYS END WITH THE FUNCTION CALL TO RESTORE NO-OP BEHAVIOR.  This
makes the update behavior a once-and-done event (so it's not repeated
accidentally with whatever impact that may have on the AP operation).

See file wccf_util_update_worker.sh.REFLASH for an example.

To effect one-time behaviors (such as a crontab change or a reflash as
illustrated in the files colocated here), the files are copied to a temp
location and modified as desired, renamed as appropriate, and moved to
the remote endpoint of the wccf_config_sync facility.  This remote
endpoint is the location to and from which each AP syncs config files.
Note that each AP has its own subdirectory so in order to update ten
APs in the field, the collection of update files (see #1 - 4) would have 
to go into each of the ten subdirectories corresponding to the target
APs.  Those directories are named with the MAC address of each AP.
Hence, the target APs' MAC addresses must be known.

The sync process moves files from and to the AP local directory
/etc/config.  These update-related files will be delivered to the AP in
the next sync cycle.  Shortly after that (4 minutes in the default
crontab file), the update will take place.
