# The AP may boot up with a bad time.  This cannot be helped due to
# the lack of a system board realtime clock (and clock shift). After
# running for a time (600+ seconds?), we can expect an NTP clock set.
# Below does an initial time report at boot up and then, if it
# determines that the time has been corrected, it reports another
# (corrected boot time) to the same tracking file.

# WARNING: For long-running tests, space mgmt of the tracking file
# may need to be added to this script (eg, replace date/time text
# with simple counts to reduce progressive file-size increases).
