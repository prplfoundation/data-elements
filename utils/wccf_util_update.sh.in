# WCCF generalitzed update script
#
# Execute cmd-line provided script or fail silently
#
# $1 = worker script filename WITHOUT path (MUST BE IN /etc/config)
# This worker script must be in /etc/config because that is the
# location served by the rsync config backup/restore feature.
#
# Example:
#    /usr/sbin/wccf_util_update.sh wccf_util_update_worker.sh
#
# NOTE: each customized worker script SHOULD, under any circumstance, restore
# itself to be effectively a no-op at its conclusion.  See the default
# implementation of wccf_util_update_worker.sh for best-practice technique
# to achieve this.
