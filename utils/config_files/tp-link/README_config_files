TP-LINK CONFIG FILES

After an OpenWrt image flash, copy these files to the TP-LINK Archer
C7 and reboot after OpenWrt flash to configure wireless and other
important aspects. SEE BELOW:
 
In this directory are five files that set initial configurations for
ssh (dropbear), wireless, network, firewall, and a root password 
(shadow).

NOTE: File tp-link/copy_configs.sh is available to do the following.

Here, and in the script, IP 192.168.1.1 is hard-coded.  Verify that
default LAN address is the desired destination before proceeding.

If, rather than using a LAN port, you are connected over the WAN port
note that these files may cause the device to acquire a new IP addr
for its WAN port and loss of connectivity - necessitating a
reconnection through a LAN port.

After flashing the AP with a WCCF-enabled image, these files should
be transferred to the AP with (note, two destinations accessed):

$ scp dropbear wireless network firewall root@192.168.1.1:/etc/config/
$ scp shadow root@192.168.1.1:/etc/

At that point, the AP now has a root password (from shadow) which is:

Wccf.Rt.Pw

This above password will be required to ssh to the AP, or to access
the Web Mgmt U/I.

Once restarted, the AP will have wireless enabled with SSID, Security,
and shared passwords set.

FINAL NOTE:

Cat file wireless herein to verify the values you have configured or
to make desired changes prior to use.
