These are the configurations that can be saved during a flash, or, 
modified by a flash/install.

The zipped tar file here was created with this sysupgrade cmd:

# sysupgrade -v -b sysupgrade-create-backup.tar.gz

That file was expanded in a subdirectory, and this script was
against the content:

$ catall.sh > openwrt_default_configs.out

That output file is included here.
